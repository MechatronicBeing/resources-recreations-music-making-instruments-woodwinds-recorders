Recorder

Version 2020-12-05

Samples of a wooden recorder performed and recorded by Eugene Vlaskin on March
2018 for the FreePats project. The raw samples were processed and modified by
roberto@zenvoid.org.

"Venus" wooden recorder, AKG HT40 mini microphone + AKG SR40 mini receiver,
Creative Labs Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 Pro (SB1095), Audacity software.

There are two sets of samples. The main sound bank, "Recorder", contains both
sets of samples and they will be chosen randomly. "RecorderN1" and
"RecorderN2" are alternative sound banks that contain different samples per
note. Their differences are normally not noticeable if only one instrument is
playing, but it can make a difference when two recorders are playing at the
same time.

This sound bank, in several formats and qualities, is available on the
FreePats project web pages: http://freepats.zenvoid.org/
